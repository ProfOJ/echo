Big Data Cloud Connected to Consumer products that harness financial data from SMEs for the financial service use:
Why?
 Imagine a vast network of interconnected digital information, like a giant cloud. This cloud is specifically designed to handle massive amounts of data, hence the term "Big Data Cloud." Now, within this cloud, there's a connection to consumer productsâ€”basically, everyday things that people use.

Now, these consumer products are not just regular items; they're smart and connected. They can gather information and send it to the Big Data Cloud. What kind of information, you ask? Well, it's a mix of consumer-related data and financial data from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Here's the interesting part: all this data isn't just sitting there doing nothing. It's being utilized for financial services. Picture this: small businesses providing their financial information, which gets processed and analyzed within the Big Data Cloud. Financial services, like loans or investment advice, can then be tailored based on these insights.

So, in a nutshell, it's about using the power of big data and the connectivity of consumer products to gather and analyze financial data from small and medium-sized businesses. This, in turn, opens up possibilities for offering more targeted and effective financial services to these businesses. Cool, right?
